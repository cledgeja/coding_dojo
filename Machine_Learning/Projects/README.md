## Subtitle describing the analysis 

**Author**: Jason Cledgett

### Business problem:

Can an outlet predict sales with the following variables. Item Weight, Item Visibility, Item MRP, Item Type, Item Fat Content, Outlet Size, Outlet Type and Outlet Location Type


### Data:
Dataset includes 8,523 rows with 12 columns. Item_Weight is missing 1463 rows and Outlet Size is missing 2410 rows. 


## Methods
- To prep the data for Machine Learning columns where categorized into features (Numeric, Ordinal, Nominal)
- To handle missing data, the mean was applied to Item Weight and Most Frequent was applied to outlet size
-
